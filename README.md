# ChatSystem-POO

This project is a Chat System that works locally : this means it works in a local IP network, not on the full internet.
We consider that using this application is as easy and intuitive as we could make it.

In order to run the application, yo have to download this Git repository, open a terminal in the git folder you created and run the  following command :
```
java -jar ./ChatSystem/dist/JARFile/ChatSystem.jar
```
