# ChatSystem-POO

This project is a Chat System that works locally : this means it works in a local IP network, not on the full internet. In this specific version (the one on this branch) we have a connection to the servlet implemented. You should only use this version if you are at INSA Toulouse in the DGEI and connected to the GEI IP network. This is because in this version the program will try to access a local server only accessible from local IP network.

We consider that using this application is as easy and intuitive as we could make it.

In order to run the application, yo have to download this Git repository, open a terminal in the git folder you created and run the  following commands :
```
cd ChatSystem/dist/JARFile/
java -jar ChatSystem.jar
```
